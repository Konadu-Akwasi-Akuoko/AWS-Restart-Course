2. **[Basic computing concepts](/Cloud-Foundations/02-Basic-Computing-Concepts/README.md):** concepts of servers, including traditional and cloud models, the function and use of virtual machines in cloud computing, and the phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC).

3. **[Development team roles](/Cloud-Foundations/03-Development-Team-Roles/README.md):** roles within a development team, including the project manager who leads the team, the analyst who defines project purposes and gathers requirements, the quality assurance who creates and maintains tests, the software developer who writes and maintains the application code, and the database administrator who manages the applicationâ€™s data.

4. **[What is cloud computing](/Cloud-Foundations/04-What-Is-Cloud-Computing/README.md):** an overview of cloud computing, contrasting it with traditional computing models, explaining different cloud service and deployment models, and outlining the various applications of cloud computing.

5. **[Advantages of cloud computing](/Cloud-Foundations/05-Advantages-Of-Cloud-Computing/README.md):** the advantages of cloud computing, including cost-effectiveness, scalability, speed, and global reach, which are driving many companies to transition from traditional computing models to cloud-based solutions.

6. **[What is AWS](/Cloud-Foundations/06-What-Is-AWS/README.md):** an overview of Amazon Web Services (AWS), explaining its cloud computing models, web services, how to choose and interact with AWS services, and the benefits of using AWS for businesses, including examples of how companies can use AWS to build applications.

7. **[Fundamentals of AWS pricing](/Cloud-Foundations/07-Fundamentals-Of-AWS-Pricing/README.md):**
the AWS pricing model, which is driven by compute, storage, and outbound data transfer costs, and offers a pay-as-you-go service, with options to pay less when reserving or using more, and discusses tools like the AWS pricing calculator and the concept of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) to help businesses estimate and compare costs.

8. **[AWS infrastructure overview](/Cloud-Foundations/08-AWS-Infrastructure-Overview/README.md):** a comprehensive overview of the AWS Global Infrastructure, detailing its data centers, availability zones, regions, points of presence, and key features, and explaining how these elements contribute to the flexibility, scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability of AWS services.
