## Introduction to Computing

In todays world we can't live without computing. We buy books, watch videos, and even chat with friends all through this technology called computer. All this can happen on a computer when a user have a set of **applications** and **network** connectivity. Applications, networks, and computers run the digital world.

### Application

An application is a set of instructions that run on a computer to perform a specific task. A computer program is written using code or programming languages(a language that the computer understands). Computer programs are called softwares.

There 4 main type of applications, they are:

1. Web applications
2. Mobile applications
3. Desktop applications
4. Internet of Things applications

A computer mostly consist of the hardware and software.

### Computer Network

A computer network connects multiple devices to share data and resources. Connected devices can be of different types, such as computers, printers, storage drives, and smartphones.

A network interface card, also called a network adapter, connects a computer to a computer network. It uses a cable that is connected to a hub or switch.A wired network card uses an Ethernet cable to connect a computer to the network. A wireless network card uses a Wi-Fi signal instead.

## Basic Computing Concepts

### What is a server?

A server is a computer that provides data or services to other computers. A server provides a response to a request from a client computer over a network.

A server resides in a data center. A data center is a physical location that is used to host computer systems and associated components such as networks, storage devices, and power supplies.

Traditionally, organizations owned their data centers. The equipment was on premises at a location that the company owned. The company are the one who buys, installs, configures, and manages all the hardware and software in your own facility. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, and numerous other costs. You also must hire the staff who are responsible for the maintenance of the hardware, software, and the facility itself.

The cloud model provides another option: a cloud services provider buys the hardware and infrastructure software in their own facility. They manage and maintain it with their own personnel. You bring your application or workload to run on their servers and pay for the services that they offer.

### Virtual machines

A virtual machine is a software based computer that runs on a physical computer. The VM provides computing capabilities by accessing the physical resources of the host through a software layer, which is called a hypervisor. The hypervisor shares the host’s physical resources—such as its CPU, memory, disk drives, and networking capabilities—among the VMs that run on the host. A VM can run its own operating system, and multiple VMs can run on a single host.

VMs facilitate computing in the cloud. In the AWS Cloud, the core service that offers computing capabilities as virtual machines is the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

### Software development lifecycle

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process that is used to produce software in a disciplined and organized way.

At a high level, the purpose of each phase can be described by the following questions and actions:

- **Plan:** What is the problem, and what resources do you need to solve it?

- **Analyze:** What do you want from a solution?

- **Design:** How will you built what you want?

- **Develop:** Build what you have designed.

- **Test:** Did you get what you want?

- **Implement:** Start to use what you built.

- **Maintain:** Improve what you built.

The SDLC is repeated over the lifetime of an application. It is used to create, update, fix, and maintain the application over a period of time.
