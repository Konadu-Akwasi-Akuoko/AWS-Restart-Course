<summary><h3>Linux Summary</h3></summary>

1. **[Introduction to Linux](/Linux/01-Introduction-To-Linux/README.md):** Linux is an open-source operating system that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, and runs applications. A Linux distribution includes the Linux kernel, daemons, applications, data files, and configuration files, and examples include Amazon Linux 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, and Ubuntu.

2. **[Linux Command Line](/Linux/02-Linux-Command-Line/README.md):** The Linux command line is a text interface for your computer where you can run commands. It starts with a login process where your username and password are checked for authenticity. The command line includes various commands like `whoami` to display the current user, `id` to show user and group information, `hostname` to display the system's name, and others like `uptime`, `date`, `cal`, `clear`, `echo`, `history`, `touch`, `cat` which perform various functions. It also handles standard input, output, and error streams for commands, and features like tab completion and command history for ease of use.

3. **[Linux Users and Groups](/Linux//03-Linux-Users-And-Groups/README.md):** Linux users and groups are managed through various commands and stored in specific files. User accounts can be created, modified, or deleted using commands like `useradd`, `usermod`, and `userdel`, with user information stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. Similarly, groups can be managed using `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel`, with group information stored in the `/etc/group` file. Permissions and access can be controlled through these user and group settings, with root users having the most access.

4. **[Editing Files in Linux](/Linux/04-Editting-Files-In-Linux/README.md):** a comprehensive guide to editing files in Linux using Vim, Nano, and Gedit text editors. It details the different modes, commands, and effects in Vim and Nano, and mentions that Gedit is a GUI text editor with menu buttons available.

5. **[Working with the file system](/Linux/05-Working-With-The-File-System/README.md):** a comprehensive guide to working with the Linux file system, emphasizing that everything in Linux is a file, including commands, hardware, and directories. It details various commands (`ls`, `more`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rmdir`, `pwd`) and their options, the Linux File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS), and the principles of Linux file names and extensions.

6. **[Working with files in Linux](/Linux/06-Working-With-FIles-In-Linux/REDME.md):** a comprehensive guide to working with files in Linux, covering various commands such as `hash`, `cksum`, `find`, `grep`, `diff`, `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`, and `unzip`. It explains how each command works, their common usages, options, and provides examples. The guide also discusses concepts like hard and symbolic links, inodes, and the differences between `grep` and `find`.

7. **[Managing Linux File Permissions](/Linux/07-Managing-Linux-File-Permissions/README.md):** a comprehensive guide on managing Linux file permissions. It explains the different types of permissions (read, write, execute), the concept of user, group, and other identities, and the default permissions for root and non-root users. It also details the usage of `chown` and `chmod` commands in Linux, including their syntax, options, and examples in both symbolic and absolute modes.
