# Advantages of Cloud Computing

- How does cloud computing benefit you?
  - Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the internet. Cloud storage is a good example of cloud computing.
- If you have a business, how can cloud computing benefit your business?
  - Cloud computing or cloud services providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources
- Why are so many companies interested in moving to the cloud?
  - Companies are moving to the cloud because it presents many benefits including cost savings because you pay only for the resources that you use.This slide provides answers to the questions posed on the previous slide.Next, you explore the major reasons why so many companies are moving to the cloud.

## Why are so many companies moving to the cloud?

1. Trading fix expenses for variable (pay as you go) expenses, when it comes to infrastructure.
2. Benefits from massive economy of scale, because many people are using AWS it brings down the cost of operations at AWS so this reduction in cost is passed on the users of AWS which results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.
3. Reduce guessing capacity. With on-prem model you either get underutilized servers or over burdened servers, with cloud computing you can scale up or down as needed.
4. With cloud computing you don't guess much about your maximum peaks in terms of usage. In traditional model it's either you buy too much and waste money or buy too less and have downtimes.
5. Increase your speed and agility. In cloud computing spinning up a server is just a matter of click away, and this leads to provisioning of servers to your developers really fast, something that can take up to weeks.
6. No more expenses for running and maintaining data centers. With cloud computing companies can focus on their core business goal and not about installing and managing servers.
7. Going global in minutes. With cloud computing you can provision servers at different locations around the globe that is closer to your users therefore reducing latency between your users devices and the server.
