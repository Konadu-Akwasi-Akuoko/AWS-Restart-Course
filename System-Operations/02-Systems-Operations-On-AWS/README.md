# Systems Operations on AWS

## What is systems operations (SysOps)?

Systems operations (SysOps) is concerned with the deployment, administration, and monitoring of systems and network resources in an automatable and reusable manner.

SysOps contains critical tasks that keep many companies running today. SysOps supports technical systems by monitoring them and helping ensure that their performance meets expectations and is trouble-free. SysOps typically requires understanding a system's entire environment.

Benefits of SysOps include the following:

- Ability to configure and manage thousands of servers and devices in a repeatable way
- Reduction in errors by replacing manual processes with automated ones
- Real-time visibility into the state of the infrastructure through monitoring

## Systems operations: Responsibilities

SysOps involves the responsibilities and tasks required to build (create), test, deploy, monitor, maintain, and safeguard complex computing systems. Examples of these tasks include the following:

- Build: Create separate environments for development, test, and production.
- Test: Test backup and disaster recovery procedures.
- Deploy: Deploy applications and workloads into their runtime environment.
- Monitor: Monitor the health and performance of infrastructure resources.
- Maintain: Apply patches and upgrades in a consistent and regular manner.
- Safeguard: Apply and enforce security measures in all the infrastructure layers.

## Systems operations in the cloud

Cloud computing provides organizations the ability to automate the development, testing, and deployment of complex IT operations.

Automation of SysOps provides the following:

- Repeatable deployment of infrastructure and applications on demand
- Creation of self-describing systems
- Ability to build well-tested, secure systems

Consider the concept of automation, which plays a vital role in SysOps. Instead of building pieces of a complex computing infrastructure manually, you can define the pieces declaratively or programmatically and use automated methods to create them.

You can accomplish automation by creating scripts, programs, or templates, such as the following:

- A Linux shell script
- A Python or Ruby application
- A C# application
- A template format, such as what is used in the AWS CloudFormation service

The cloud facilitates the automation of SysOps tasks. For example, you can provision computing resources in minutes in the cloud through a completely automated script. However, in an on-premises environment, the same process could require days and a manual intervention if you need to procure and wait for more hardware.
