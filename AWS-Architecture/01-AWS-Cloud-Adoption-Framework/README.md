# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework

## AWS CAF defined

The AWS CAF provides guidance and best practices to help organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing across the organization.

Each organization’s cloud adoption journey is unique. However, for any organization to successfully migrate its IT portfolio to the cloud, three elements—people, process, and technology—must be aligned. Business and technology leaders in an organization must understand the organization’s current state and target state. They also must understand the transition that is needed to achieve the target state so that they can set goals and create processes for staff.

The AWS CAF breaks down the complex process of planning a move to the cloud into manageable pieces that are called perspectives. Perspectives represent essential areas of focus that span people, processes, and technology. Capabilities within each perspective identify which areas of your organization require attention. From that viewpoint, actions are organized into prescriptive work streams that support a successful cloud journey.

## Core perspectives

Each perspective covers distinct responsibilities that functionally related stakeholders own or manage. In general, the Business, People, and Governance perspectives focus on business capabilities. The Platform, Security, and Operations perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

| Focus on Business Capabilities | Focus on Technical Capabilities |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Business                       | Platform                       |
| People                         | Security                       |
| Governance                     | Operations                     |

This focus helps the organization maximize the business value of its IT investment and minimize the business risks.

## Platform perspective

Platform perspective capabilities

- Compute provisioning
- Network provisioning
- Storage provisioning
- Database provisioning
- Systems and solution architecture
- Application development

Stakeholders from the Platform perspective include the chief technology officer (CTO), IT managers, and solutions architects. They use a variety of architectural dimensions and models to understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships. They must be able to describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail. The AWS CAF includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud and for migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.

## Security perspective

Security perspective capabilities•\

- Identity and access management
- Detective control
- Infrastructure security
- Data protection
- Incident response

Stakeholders from the Security perspective include the chief information security officer (CISO), IT security managers, and IT security analysts. They must ensure that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility. Security perspective stakeholders can use the AWS CAF to structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organization’s needs.

## Operations perspective

Operations perspective capabilities

- Service monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Resource inventory management
- Release management or change management
- Reporting and analytics
- Business continuity or disaster recovery (DR)

Stakeholders from the Operations perspective (for example, IT operations managers and IT support managers) define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business is conducted. Stakeholders from the Operations perspective align with and support the operations of the business. The AWS CAF helps these stakeholders define current operating procedures. It also helps them identify the process changes and training that are needed to implement successful cloud adoption.
